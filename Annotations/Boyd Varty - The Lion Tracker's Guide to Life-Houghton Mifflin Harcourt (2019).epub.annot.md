"it’s easy for me to follow the trail of his ancestors back to the roots of science, back to the roots of art, when an ancient tracker saw a print in soft sand and realized that the abstract shape represented something.

32. "In my own life, I have often struggled with the first track. Full of grand visions and the desire to do something great, I often couldn’t find the first small beginning and then the next small beginning.

I forget what I look like. I’m surprised to find that the world doesn’t end, and in fact I become happier and less lonely with each day. I transition from endless doing into a steady being. Occasionally, some task that I need to do will arise crisply out of nowhere. I notice it, attend to it, and then drop back into a gentle ease with myself.
